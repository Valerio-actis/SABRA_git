! if we want to keep adding files to the spectra, so that they are added to the averages, we should update the parameter
! stat in such a way that sind, tind and find start with a value = (last spectr, flux or times file) +1. This simply
! means considering the last file "uu.XXXXX.out" in the status folder, the associated number is the time index which
